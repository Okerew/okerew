Longer description:  
I am a full stack developer, also a student which mainly programs in Python and JavaScript, sometimes in Rust and Java. I also sometimes use ChatGPT for docstrings and repetitive parts.

Note: I analyze the code that it is outputting for any security issues and overall issues.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Okrolearn, Okral Code Editor, A native alternative to docker for macos
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C, C++
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on some machine learning projects
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with extensions for Okral Code Editor. Help with Okrolearn would also be nice.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: az/best (this is a joke, I am male, please don't take it personally if you were offended).
